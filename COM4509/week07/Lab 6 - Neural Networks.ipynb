    "## 1. Review of Autograd: Automatic Differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lab, we briefly covered **Tensor** and **Computational Graph**. We have actually used **Autograd** already. Here, we learn the basics below, a condensed and modified version of the original [PyTorch tutorial on Autograd](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/autograd_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-beginner-blitz-autograd-tutorial-py)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why differentiation is important? \n",
    "\n",
    "This is because it is a key procedure in **optimisation** to find the optimial solution of a loss function. The process of learning/training aims to minimise a predefined loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How automatic differentiation is done in PyTorch?\n",
    "The PyTorch ``autograd`` package makes differentiation (almost) transparent to you by providing automatic differentiation for all operations on Tensors, unless you do not want it (to save time and space). \n",
    "\n",
    "A ``torch.Tensor`` type variable has an attribute ``.requires_grad``. Setting this attribute ``True`` tracks (but not computes yet) all operations on it. After we define the forward pass, and hence the *computational graph*, we call ``.backward()`` and all the gradients will be computed automatically and accumulated into the ``.grad`` attribute. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is made possible by the [**chain rule of differentiation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to stop automatic differentiation (e.g., because it is not needed)\n",
    "Calling method ``.detach()`` of a tensor will detach it from the computation history. We can also wrap the code block in ``with torch.no_grad():`` so all tensors in the block do not track the gradients, e.g., in the test/evaluation stage. "

    "## 2. Artificial Neurons and Full Connected Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed in the lecture, a simple model of a biological neuron is one where it takes a weighted sum of all it's inputs before transforming it via a non-linear activation function. Historically, this activation function was a step function or more commonly the logistic sigmoid function. In this way, the logistic regression model we saw last week is effectively a single neuron. Mathematically it is defined as\n",
    "$$ y_i = f \\left( b_i + \\sum_{j=1}^M W_{ij} x_j \\right) $$\n",
    "where $y_i$ is the value of neuron $i$, $f()$ is the non-linear activation function (e.g sigmoid), $W_{ij}$ is the weight connecting input $x_j$ to neuron $y_i$ and $b_i$ is the bias value for neuron $i$ (this could also be written as $W_{i0}$ but here we use $b$ to align with the PyTorch implementation which separates it out).\n",
    "This can be written in a vector form as\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{y} = f \\left( \\mathbf{b} + W \\mathbf{x} \\right) $$\n",
    "This is the case where we have a single input vector, libraries like PyTorch typically process a batch (or mini-batch) of inputs at the same time. In this case if $\\mathbf{x}$ is a 2d array shaped (Batch size, Input size) then this operation can be written as\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{y} = f \\left( \\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{x} W^T \\right) $$\n",
    "where now $\\mathbf{y}$ is also a 2d array but with a shape (Batch size, Number of neurons). We have to transpose $W$ so that the shapes of the arrays are correct while mathematically to operation is the same. Note that we also need to broadcast the bias vector to each sample output in the batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "In PyTorch the weighted sum is known as a fully connected **linear** layer (see the documentation [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Linear.html)). PyTorch has a submodule of the library called ``torch.nn`` that contains implementations of various common neural network operations that make building neural network models easy. You started using these in Lab 6 but let's look at chaining them together to create neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single layer of neurons are similar to what we have seen for linear and logistic regression. While these work for some situations, they are only linear models so when it comes to predicting classes or outputs which have complex non-linear relations of the inputs then we need to expand our models. We have already discussed using basis functions and design matrices to modify our input to include a non-linear basis. In artificial neural networks, we rely on connecting layers of neurons to discover these complex feature representations for us. So if we have a non-linear task that we want to solve we can instead create a stack of neuron layers, this is a specific form of neural networks known as a **feedforward neural network** (FFNN). In a FFNN the neurons only propagate information in one direction with no communication within layers. A 2 layer FFNN can be described as:\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\mathbf{h} = f_{(1)} \\left( \\mathbf{x} W^T_{(1)} \\right) \\\\\n",
    "\\mathbf{y} = f_{(2)} \\left( \\mathbf{h} W^T_{(2)} \\right)\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "where $\\mathbf{h}$ are the values of the neurons in the intermediate layer, usually known as a hidden layer. $\\mathbf{y}$ is the values of the neurons in the final layer, which are usually known as the output neurons. When we are training the network we will usually be guiding these outputs towards a particular target. In this case we have 2 activation functions and 2 weight matrices which are describing the connection between the input and hidden layer, and then between the hidden layer and output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at implementing this using PyTorch. We will use a simple example where we have an input size of 3, 4 neurons in the hidden layer and 1 output neuron."

    "Now we can create a model that has the correct number of inputs and outputs. Remember, when we are training these classifiers we generally use a `one-hot` encoded target. You can interpret this as the posterior probabilities (i.e the probability that input $x$ belongs to to class $i$) so each element of the output array will be related to $P(\\mathrm{class}=i | \\mathbf{x})$ and to make a classification we will need to find the predicted output that has the largest value. In this example we will look at using the Cross Entropy Loss (CEL) function for training our model. It is defined as \n",
    "$$ L = - \\sum_{n=1}^N \\sum_{i=1}^{C} t_{ni} \\log(p_{ni}) $$\n",
    "where $t_{ni}$ is the one-hot encoded target of sample $n$ and $p_{ni}$ is the predicted output probability of class $i$ of sample $n$. $N$ is the total number of samples and $C$ the number of classes (i.e. outputs). Compared to the mean-squared error, where we use the squared magnitude of the difference between the predictions and targets, this is measuring the difference in the probability distributions of our target and predictions. It is specifically expecting the prediction to be in terms of a probability and one of the best ways to convert a multi-class output into a probability is to use the **softmax** operation.This converts an array into a normalised probability by applying the following operation\n",
    "$$ p_{ni} = \\frac{\\exp(y_{ni})}{\\sum_j \\exp({y_{nj}})} ,$$\n",
    "where $n$ is for a sample and $i$ indicates the output index of the network. The division here computes the total 'probability' and normalises it. By using softmax and Cross-Entropy Loss we change the output range that our neural network is being trained to learn. For mean squared error we would want our outputs to be usually in the range 0 to 1, or -1 to 1, but now we can see from the softmax operation to maximise the probability of one class over the others we will want the outputs to be +$\\infty$ for the correct output and $-\\infty$ for the others. This wider range can help during the training.\n",
    "\n",
    "In PyTorch, the cross entropy loss function will automatically apply the softmax to a network output so when we create the network we leave the final layer as a linear layer rather than applying an activation function. We still need an activation function for the hidden layer.\n",

    "The fast rising of [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) starts on 30 September 2012, when a convolutional neural network (CNN) called [AlexNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet) achieved a top-5 error of 15.3% in the ImageNet 2012 Challenge, more than **10.8 percentage** points lower than that of the runner up. This is considered a breakthrough and has grabbed the attention of increasing number of researchers, practioners, and the general public. Since then, deep learning has penetrated to many research and application areas. AlexNet contained **eight layers**. A sketch of it is given below to show how it combines convolution layers with fully connected (dense) ones to perform classification.\n",

    "A typical CNN architecture can be seen here. Each layer has a set of convolution filters, also known as kernels. Each filter is shared across the outputs of the layer, a more intuitive way is to consider that the filter is 'scanning' across the image and the resulting output is what we call a feature map. Essentially this means a map of where each of the features the filters are finding are present in the input image. This means that the output of the convolution is also image-like data. The layers process in turn to build up lower level features into complex high level features.\n",
