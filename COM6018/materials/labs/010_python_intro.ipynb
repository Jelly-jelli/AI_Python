The demo imagines that you have two snippets of DNA and wish to compare them by seeing how many matching bases they have. However, the two sequences are not aligned, i.e. the snippets don't start at exactly the same position in the DNA sequence. The demo will align the sequences by shifting one of them to the right and then score the alignment by counting the number of matching bases. The alignment with the highest score is the best alignment and is used to compute the similarity between the two sequences, i.e. the percentage of bases that match.\n",
