# Search Sckit learn popular version
conda search scikit-learn

# Specific the version
conda install ipython matplotlib=3.7 scipy=1.9

# List env of Conda

#Use the --freeze-installed option. 
This may force Conda to install older versions of the requested packages in order to maintain 
compatibility with previously installed packages. 
Using the --freeze-installed option does not prevent additional dependency packages from being installed.

# List Conda basic-scipy-env
conda list --name basic-scipy-env
conda list --name machine-learning-39-env

# Lis† library
conda list

# Deleting Entire environment 
conda remove --name basic-scipy-env --all

What are Conda channels?
Conda packages are downloaded from remote channels, which are URLs to directories containing conda packages. 
The conda command searches a standard set of channels, referred to as defaults. The defaults channels include:

main: The majority of all new Anaconda, Inc. package builds are hosted here. Included in defaults as the top priority channel.
r: Microsoft R Open conda packages and Anaconda, Inc.’s R conda packages.

# Search for package in channel 
conda search --channel conda-forge kaggle

# In conda if you want to use python
python 
exit()

# Exporting environment file
1. cmd : source activate myenv
2. cmd : 
cd Desktop
conda export myenv > environment.yml

# Create environment from File 
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Cloning Environment
conda create --name myclone --clone myenv

cd COM6018
conda env create -f com6018.environment.yml
# To activate this environment, use
# $ conda activate com6018
